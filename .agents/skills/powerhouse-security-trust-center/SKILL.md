# Powerhouse Security Trust Center

Fingerprint: `powerhouse|security-trust|evidence-first|v1`.

## Invariants
- Trust surfaces are private portal capabilities: only authenticated customers and Bedrijfsgeheugen administrators may see them; demo/public access is forbidden.
- Customer trust APIs must resolve the tenant server-side; canonical Bedrijfsgeheugen scope is admin-only.
- Legacy standalone URLs may only deep-link into authenticated Portal V2 and must never render independent trust data.
- Never turn provider SOC/ISO/security assurance into a Bedrijfsgeheugen certification claim.
- Never turn legal framework relevance into a compliance conclusion without applicability evidence.
- Never keep IAM/account evidence green after its expiry; use STALE.
- Derive database posture from live catalog/privilege evidence where possible.
- Reuse the data-sovereignty heartbeat; do not create a second scheduler.
- Preserve tenant isolation and server-side tenant resolution.
- Surface answers where the customer asks them: data location, access, AI training, cross-border transfer, open findings and relevant frameworks.
- Unknown is a valid result and is never silently promoted to verified.
- Production/provider readback is required before LIVE_BEWEZEN.
